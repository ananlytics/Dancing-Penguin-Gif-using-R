# Dancing-Penguin-Gif-using-R
A slowly rotating spiral galaxy where every single dot is a real penguin, positioned and styled by its actual biological measurements — created with almost zero external dependencies
The project means to create a representation of pengines of different species, size, fippers etc. arranged and rotating as a galaxy would. Each dot in this art represents a unique Penguin.

We would use Rstudio/Posit to accomplish this. This artwork will be created without any external dependencies i.e. no additional library needs to be installed and called. We won't be using ggplot2 either. We will use 'palmerpenguins' data set and create a beautiful gif to imitate penguins worshipping a galaxy (essentially it's a bunch of dots ordered according to it's characteristics and rotating)
