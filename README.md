# Dancing-Penguin-Gif-using-R
A slowly rotating spiral galaxy where every single dot is a real penguin, positioned and styled by its actual biological measurements — created with almost zero external dependencies
The project means to create a representation of pengines of different species, size, fippers etc. arranged and rotating as a galaxy would. Each dot in this art represents a unique Penguin.
